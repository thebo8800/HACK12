When I came around the concrete truck there was an employee, who I believe to be the crew lead, leaning across the excavation with one hand on the pole attempting to level it without fall protection or guardrails in place. I asked said individual how far the concrete was to the top of excavation, in which he replied 5 - 6. I cautiously approached the hole to investigate, in which I determined that distance to be 10 - 12. I then stopped the crew and asked them to step back away from the excavation while I investigated further. To give some backstory, it was determined earlier in the project that if the pole butt was in the excavation that fall protection and guardrails were not necessary because there was only 6 - 10 of space between the pole and excavation wall not leaving enough space for an individual to fall in. In speaking with the employees they stated the above as to why there were not appropriate precautions put in place. I then stated that this was not a normal size hole, with this hole having 18 - 3 from pole to excavation wall, and that fall protection and guardrails were absolutely necessary due to these distances. I then coached them that they need to be proactive about looking for, identifying, and then putting appropriate precautions in place to combat hazards and not to just falling back on what they have been doing. After speaking with the crew I approached their safety rep which was sitting in his truck about 60yrds away and out of view of the work being preformed. While speaking with the safety rep he stated that we ( AEP ) needed to have some consistency because it was fine for them to utilize the practice stated above before but now it is not acceptable. I then stated to him that they needed to use common sense and that if there was sufficient amount of room for an individual to fall in the excavation that fall protection and guard rails were absolutely necessary. [NAME] wanted to investigate for himself so we walked to the excavation and he then determined that fall protection and rails were needed. One thing I found particularly troubling was that they had both fall protection and guardrails next to the excavation and once I told them fall protection was necessary an employee had it on and was ready to work again in less than a minute.",,Uncategorized,Pressure (excavation or trench),9

Particularly, large diameter trunks are being felled and processed within the limitations ( generally, and on this site ) an MS271 type 50cc ( approx ) farm and ranch saw. It is well known that bar length selection, which implies a sufficient powerband, is an aspect of developing a 5s - tep felling plan. In particular, saws not optimized to the task increase risk exposure by decreasing the sawyer's options for work positioning in relation to the escape routes, increasing time at the periphery of the back - cut ( thus exposure in the immediate barberchair / butt kickback potential area ), increasing the likelihood of kerf misalignment due to the need to wrap around, and increasing heat transfer to the working components during a vital point of performance. Insufficient bar length and sufficient, but not optimized power bands increase the difficulty for the sawyer, especially those less experience, in creating the face cut architecture. Extended dwell times during debris processing also increase exposure rates while increasing T & M costs. [NAME] uppercanopy branches are currently serviced with domestic grade equipment, and while posing a different operational consideration, some points related to control, heat, and exposure time apply.
